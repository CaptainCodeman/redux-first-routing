# Basic Usage

In the Redux store configuration file:
- import the reducer and the middleware
- add the reducer to the root reducer (convention: under the`location` property)
- add the middleware to the array, passing it the history object created in the application entry point (shown below):

```js
// store.js
import { combineReducers, createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';
import { routerReducer, routerMiddleware } from 'redux-first-routing';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  location: routerReducer,
  // other reducers
});

export function configureStore(history, initialState = {}) {
  const middlewares = [
    routerMiddleware(history),
    // other middlewares
  ];

  const enhancers = [
    applyMiddleware(...middlewares)
  ];

  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    initialState,
    compose(...enhancers),
  );

  return store;
}
```

In the applicationâ€™s entry point:
- create the `history` object
- create the store, passing it the `history` object
- start the history listener
- render the application

```js
// index.js
import { createBrowserHistory, startListener } from 'redux-first-routing';
import configureStore from './store';

// create history
const history = createBrowserHistory();

// create store
const store = configureStore(history);

// start listening for changes in location
startListener(history, store);

// render application
...

// navigate by dispatching a navigation action
store.dispatch(push('/about'))
```

You'll need to pair this with a router to render the correct page content based on the store location. See:
